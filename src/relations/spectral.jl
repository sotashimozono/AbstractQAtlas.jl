# relations/spectral.jl — the pointwise identities relating the
# dynamical / spectral quantities.
#
# These are the frequency-resolved analogues of the thermodynamic
# identities: each holds at a single (q, ω) point (or, for the sum rule,
# given a supplied frequency integral), so each is a first-class
# `@relation` checkable against numbers.  The transform / BZ-sum / low-ω-
# limit relations that are NOT single-point live in `structure/spectral.jl`
# as the inter-quantity genealogy.
#
# Domain tag :spectral throughout, so `relation_report` can sweep a bag of
# measured propagator/response values and report every identity that
# applies.

    Dyson <: AbstractRelation

The Dyson equation relating the full and bare propagators through the
self-energy, at fixed `(q, ω)`:

`G^{-1} = G₀^{-1} − Σ`.

Written with `inv` rather than `1/…`, so the SAME identity is honest
about the orbital-tensor character of the propagators: it holds
verbatim for scalar (single-band) `G, G0, Σ` AND for matrix-valued
`G_ab, Σ_ab` in orbital/band space — `residual` returns the residual
matrix, whose norm should vanish.  (`check`/`solve` are scalar; matrix
inputs use `residual` + a norm.)  Complex-valued.

"""
    SpectralFromGreens <: AbstractRelation

The spectral representation of the retarded Green's function at `(q, ω)`:

`A = −(1/π) Im G^R`   ⟺   `A + Im(G^R)/π = 0`.

Pass the full (complex) retarded Green's function `G = G^R(q, ω)` and the real
spectral weight `A`; the imaginary part is taken in the kernel.  Keyed on the
`RetardedGreensFunction` TYPE — the same `G` as [`Dyson`](@ref) and the Keldysh
relations, never a separate `ImGR`/`GR` symbol.

    SpectralSumRule <: AbstractRelation

    DetailedBalance <: AbstractRelation

The finite-temperature detailed-balance condition on the dynamical

theorem.  Variables: `S_plus = S(q, ω)`, `S_minus = S(q, −ω)`, `ω`, and

The dynamical scaling relation fixing the NMR spin–lattice relaxation
