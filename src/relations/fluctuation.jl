    JarzynskiEquality <: AbstractRelation

Jarzynski's nonequilibrium equality (Jarzynski, [Jarzynski1997](@cite)):
the exponential average of the work `W` over many realizations of ANY protocol driving
the system between two equilibrium states equals the exponentiated equilibrium
free-energy difference, however far from equilibrium the driving is,

`⟨e^{−βW}⟩ = e^{−β ΔF}`,   `ΔF = F_B − F_A`.

Supplied-average convention: `exp_work = ⟨e^{−βW}⟩`.

Variables: `exp_work` = `⟨e^{−βW}⟩`, `ΔF`, `β` (or `T`).
"""
@relation :fluctuation JarzynskiEquality(exp_work, ΔF, β::InverseTemperature) =
    exp_work - exp(-β * ΔF)

"""
    JarzynskiSecondLaw <: AbstractInequality

The second law as the Jensen-inequality corollary of [`JarzynskiEquality`](@ref)
(`⟨e^{−βW}⟩ ≥ e^{−β⟨W⟩}` by convexity ⇒ `e^{−βΔF} ≥ e^{−β⟨W⟩}`): the average work done
on the system cannot be less than the free-energy difference,

`⟨W⟩ ≥ ΔF`

(slack `W_avg − ΔF` = the dissipated work `W_diss ≥ 0`).  Saturated by a quasistatic
(reversible) protocol; a strictly positive slack measures irreversibility.

Variables: `W_avg` = `⟨W⟩`, `ΔF`.

"""
    CrooksFluctuationTheorem <: AbstractRelation

The Crooks fluctuation theorem (Crooks, [Crooks1999](@cite)): the forward and
time-reversed work distributions of a driven process obey

`P_F(W) / P_R(−W) = e^{β (W − ΔF)}`,

crossing at `W = ΔF` (`ratio = 1`) and integrating over `W` to [`JarzynskiEquality`](@ref).
