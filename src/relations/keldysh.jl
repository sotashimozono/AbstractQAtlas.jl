# relations/keldysh.jl — the Keldysh (real-time contour) Green's-function
# structure and its equilibrium fluctuation–dissipation constraint.
#
# On the closed-time contour every two-point function is a 2×2 matrix; the
# retarded–advanced–Keldysh (RAK / Larkin–Ovchinnikov) rotation makes its
# content three independent components `(G^R, G^A, G^K)` built from the
# greater/lesser correlators `G^≷`.  Two of the relations here are ALGEBRAIC
# IDENTITIES that hold in AND out of equilibrium (definitions of the RAK
# components); the third is the CAUSALITY/adjoint tie `G^A = (G^R)†`; and the
# fourth is the physics: in thermal equilibrium the Keldysh component is not
# independent but locked to the spectral part by the FLUCTUATION–DISSIPATION
# theorem,
#
#     G^K(ω) = h(ω) · (G^R(ω) − G^A(ω)),   h(ω) = coth(βω/2) | tanh(βω/2),
#
# the distribution function `h` (bosonic | fermionic) supplied by
# `keldysh_distribution` (structure/keldysh.jl).  The `G^≷` KMS relation
# `G^<(ω) = ζ e^{−βω} G^>(ω)` is the detailed-balance root from which that `h`
# follows (see the test): FDT is a CONSEQUENCE of KMS + the RAK identities,
# not an extra axiom.  This is the real-time sibling of the Matsubara Dyson
# layer in `spectral.jl`; the spectral function `A = −Im G^R/π` bridges them
# ([`SpectralFromKeldysh`](@ref)).
