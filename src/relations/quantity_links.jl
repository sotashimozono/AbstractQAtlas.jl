# relations/quantity_links.jl — the relation → quantity map.
#
# Declares, for each relation whose subject is a named quantity, which
# `AbstractQuantity` TYPES it directly constrains (parametric families use
# the UnionAll, so `Susceptibility` matches any `Susceptibility{I}`).  This
# is the machine link that turns the registry into a queryable web:
# `relations_constraining(q)` reads it in reverse.  Included after the
# physics submodules are re-exported, so every relation + quantity name
# resolves at the top level.  Relations that constrain parameters or
# exponents rather than named quantities (scaling laws, Maxwell relations,
# the uncertainty relation) keep the default `quantities(rel) == ()`.
