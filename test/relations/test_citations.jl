# Citation discipline — docs/design/core-functions.md, pillar 3.
#
# Every relations source file that DECLARES a physics relation must carry a
# citation: a `[key](@cite)` to the doiget-verified bibliography
# (docs/references.bib, checked by the `citations` CI gate) OR an honest inline
# `(YYYY)` textbook / historical reference, in the file header's "References:"
# block or a docstring.  A file that ships a law with NO provenance fails here —
# a verify-engine that cannot cite its own laws cannot be trusted (ties the
# never-fabricate-citations rule).  Per-relation `[key](@cite)` is the
# aspirational form; the enforced minimum is per-file, matching the established
# header-"References:" convention (e.g. scaling.jl).
#
# `interface.jl` is exempt: it DEFINES the @relation/@inequality macros, and its
# `@relation :scaling Rushbrooke(...)` lines are docstring EXAMPLES (the real
# Rushbrooke is declared in scaling.jl), not registered relations.
